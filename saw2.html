        There is still a lot of work ahead of us before we can emulate the Palm

        So let's start with a motivational quote:
      </h3>
      <br />
      <h3 id="motivation">
        A pair of beavers are sitting on a dam and hear a chainsaw in the
        distance.<br /><br />
        The beaver says to the female beaver:<br /><em>
          « Do you hear? They're playing our song! »</em
        >
      </h3>
      <br />
      <button onclick="window.location.href='saw3.html'">continue</button>
